mrhappypenguin every surface in the solar system is covered in craters except europa  earth something erases the craters
delaquax we think the ocean is billions of years old we hope this mission is a prelude to more exploration
azecos no it will help us answer the big question  is europa habitable
adamkabam we see evidence for lots of geological activity hoping to get better data with this mission
djedi were figuring out if the ocean under the ice crust is habitable
sceppie we are far away from being able to do that this mission will tell us how thick ice crust is then well know what were up against
jackapedia some of the current guesses organics magnesium sulfate table salt  many others follow along with the mission as we explore
azureeyes hopefully every mission nasa does generates new questions that we hope power the future of solar system exploration
djedi not life as we know it
jackiegoordial its been considered in the past and has not been reconsidered lately

mrhappypenguin every surface in the solar system is covered in craters except europa  earth something erases the craters
delaquax we think the ocean is billions of years old we hope this mission is a prelude to more exploration
azecos no it will help us answer the big question  is europa habitable
adamkabam we see evidence for lots of geological activity hoping to get better data with this mission
djedi were figuring out if the ocean under the ice crust is habitable
sceppie we are far away from being able to do that this mission will tell us how thick ice crust is then well know what were up against
jackapedia some of the current guesses organics magnesium sulfate table salt  many others follow along with the mission as we explore
azureeyes hopefully every mission nasa does generates new questions that we hope power the future of solar system exploration
djedi not life as we know it
jackiegoordial its been considered in the past and has not been reconsidered lately
