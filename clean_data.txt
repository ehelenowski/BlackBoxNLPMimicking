hillarys refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a  increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country
median household income is down for the middle class since obama took office it will only go further down under clinton
a vote for clintonkaine is a vote for tpp nafta high taxes radical regulation and massive influx of refugees
president obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist  of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction dnc
davidwohl barack is offended that realdonaldtrump will demand that nato allies pay their fair share demsinphilly

if russia or any other country or person has hillary clintons  illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the fbi
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition  sad
many of bernies supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight  thanks megynkelly
for the record i have zero investments in russia
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy
dems dont want to talk isis bc hillarys foreign interventions unleashed isis  her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar
why arent the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers
clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war

great poll numbers are coming out all over people dont want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse maga
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc  they just got caught thats all they laughed at bernie
thank you makeamericagreatagainpictwittercompzsuwgzam
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on  minutes no way they are going to fix americas problems isis  all others laughing
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive  well
if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just cant go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
wow president obamas brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they dont look presidential to me
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged
pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didnt get indicted while bob m did
another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich

we grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today how many law enforcement and people have to …

crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country she is sooooo guilty but watch her time will come
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement
crooked hillary clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information not fit
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the us her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong bad judgement
i dont think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with murder come november  shes out
raised a lot of money for the republican party there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning lots of support win
fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security no charges wow riggedsystem

crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis  it will just go on forever we need change
the third mass attack slaughter in days by isis  dead in baghdad worst in many years we do not have leadership that can stop this
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the usag so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the usag in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away no pictures
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the usag talked only about grandkids and golf for  minutes in plane on tarmac
the system is rigged
on saturday a great man elie wiesel passed awaythe world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the usag to work out a deal the system is totally rigged  corrupt

just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd and the entire show is against methe good newsthe people get it

take a look at what happened w bill clinton the system is totally rigged does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence
bill clintons meeting was a total secret nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter
as bernie sanders said hillary clinton has bad judgement bills meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary
the reason i put up approximately  million for my successful primary campaign is very simple i want to make america great again
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx  million loan i have totally terminated the loan
the very dishonest nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my  million loan to my campaign done deal
one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldnt see how she got rich selling out america  …
for reasons only they can explain the uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better
gengm jakeda realdonaldtrump as of april this year hillary had spent  on her campaign mrtrump  self funding
isis exploded on hillary clintons watch shes done nothing about it and never will not capable
new q poll out we are going to win the whole deal and make america great again trumppictwittercomdlahncwzb

iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though im sure he would do a good job if he was the media makes everything up

crooked hillary cant close the deal with bernie sanders will be another bad day for her
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in us political history
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line you can tell them to go blank themselves  was about china not women
wow  emails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton she said they had to do with a wedding reception liar how can she run
i gave a woman named barbara res a top ny construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty so much for a nice thank you
in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in us history
the writer of the now proven false story in the nytimes michael barbaro who was interviewed on cbs this morning was unable to respond
over  women were interviewed by the nytimes yet they only wrote about  thats because there were so many positive statements
with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud
a political commentator for cnn which i no longer watch said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries i set alltime record
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems the system is rigged against him he should run as an independent run bernie run
the washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration

why did the failing nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers dishonest
wow i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing nytimes piece massive front page for that
why doesnt the failing nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women the media is totally dishonest

goofy elizabeth warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked hillary see her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you…

get out and vote west virginia we will make america great again
i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against  other people
if i only had  person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton i would have gotten  million more votes than she did
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump but i had  people to beat she had one
i will win the election against crooked hillary despite the people in the republican party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me
crooked hillary just cant close the deal with bernie it will be the same way with isis and china on trade and mexico at the border bad

i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate i will defeat them both

remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing nytimes wrote a critical article i was so right
donvito a picture is worth a thousand words realdonaldtrump  lyingted nevercruz  melaniatrump pictwittercombvvewmvf
make america great again
i think having jebs endorsement hurts lyin ted jeb spent more than  and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first
i will be the best by far in fighting terror im the only one that was right from the beginning  now lyin ted  others are copying me
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror shes been in office fighting terror for  years and look where we are
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin ted cruz honestly i cant blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion
lyin ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas  just another dishonest politician
lyin ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania thats why we call him lyin ted
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget
incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and openand let the muslims flow in  no way
lyin ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin ted or i will spill the beans on your wife
pres obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately  get home to washington where a potus under a serious emergency belongs
obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame
my heart  prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible brussels tragedy this madness must be stopped and i will stop it
watch this clip from earlier this year time  time again i have been right about terrorism its time to get tough
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and its not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today
make america great again
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world us must be vigilant and smart
barrong realdonaldtrump the media is corrupt we the people are fighting with you
wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasnt even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect
so the highly overrated anchor megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i cant fight back wrong
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters
why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roadsdoors during my rallies  are never blamed by media sad

mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesnt have a clue no wonder he lost
failed presidential candidate mitt romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing lyin ted cruz this is good for me
going to salt lake city utah for a big rally lyin ted cruz should not be allowed to win there  mormons dont like liars i beat hillary
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up can anyone explain this
lyin ted cruz lost all five races on tuesdayand he was just given the jinx  a lindsey graham endorsement also backed jeb lindsey got
hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life
make america great again
who should star in a reboot of liar liar hillary clinton or ted cruz let me know
highly overrated  crazy megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me focus on others megyn
please explain to the dummies at the wsj  editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc all  of them
wsj is bad at math the good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me
wsj editorial says clinton primary vote total is trumps is a knock but she had only  opponentsi had apologize
the reason lyin ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just dont tolerate liarsa big problem
great news that foxnews has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating
crazy megynkelly supposedly had lyin ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted cant win
stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of mitt romneys historic loss is now telling the republican party what to do with trump sad

dr ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies
cruz just lied again i am and have been totally against obamacare repeal and replace
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud
this was sent out from ted cruz as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote cruzfraudpictwittercomtrmkucrsu
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice  a total lie
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
ted cruz didnt win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad

jebbush is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads

so since the people at the nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write incompetent

the nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control with unfunded liabilitiesbig trouble
the failing nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on donald trump

one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
why would anybody listen to mittromney he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain
congrats to the new gov of texas gregabbotttx for taking a tough  bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
its a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
i will make this right for our great vets
john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes

entrepreneurs do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail  ralph waldo emerson
entrepreneurs focus on your goals not on fixed patterns do whats necessary and whats unnecessary will be made clear
entrepreneurs dont sell yourself short dont ever think youve done it all already or that youve done your best
entrepreneurs keep your eyes on your ideals as well as reality accentuate the positive without being blind to the negative

madrina realdonaldtrump any chance youll change your mind and run for president gotmyvote  time will tell
mguarino realdonaldtrump  how would you treat the syria situation if president  id let them all fight with each otherfocus on us
it is truly amateur hour at the white house  and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now
illuminatisep realdonaldtrump  you should be president  save america  thank you
president obamas weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly in more ways than money attack on syria
timifel realdonaldtrump you always have something negative to say about obama dont you  yes
irazaalishah realdonaldtrump  donald you are antiobama no matter what obama does you will take the opposite view  wrongall on merit
dickquinn realdonaldtrump obviously amateur hour at the wh obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so
politixchick just from reading his tweets it seems like realdonaldtrump could run our country much better than our president right now
did anyone notice that obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us he couldnt even get britain no leadership
be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune laugh at us
obama now just wants to save face russia is now telling him dont do it he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes call it the plenty of notice war
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk  they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsamazing
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syriabig mistake if he does not
joespro realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly  but the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse
kingsfansouth realdonaldtrump i usually agree with you not tonight stop criticizing the presidenti will when he makes good decisions
jenconservative rkdrake realdonaldtrump i would be totally surprised if the us even has any money to spend on syria we dont
kswizzle realdonaldtrump what would you do  give a solution vs being so critical  i would make america great again
leebandoni realdonaldtrump for once the uk has seen sense and not been dragged into this they were for once very smart
how bad has our leader made us look on syria stay out of syria we dont have the leadership to win wars or even strategize
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the us will look very bad
is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria our leaders dont know what they are doing
the ratings of the cycle on msnbc a sad and pathetic show are way down if they fired racist moron toure a truly stupid guy they live

wow cnbc ratings are really low worst in many years i guess ill have to start doing my tuesday morning interviews with them again
the united states needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first
let the arab league take care of syria why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria watch russia as they say in the movies shoot first and talk later
i wonder what the great generals like patton the big m or robert e lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack
janusdcjavu realdonaldtrump the one who talks much does nothing except make  billion dollars  go get a job dumbass
voicelikeariot realdonaldtrump washingtonpost why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid
ronniedunn realdonaldtrump hunterboss a few billion more dollars but id rather say  president trump than president gates
that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not uswe should start rebuilding our own country  military
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria why cant we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise
i give the presidents speech a  on the scale of  to  not bad but room for improvement
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington he doesnt want to detract from his press  glory
jamieaydt one day i hope to be successful  a bit controversial like realdonaldtrump keeping things interesting  classy go for it
hunterboss realdonaldtrump im going to keep tweeting and annoying you until you run for president trump thats ok with me
hunterboss realdonaldtrump bill gates has nothing on donald trump trump

how does a dummy like billmaher get a television show his ratings stink youd think hbo could do a lot better
there is nothing i would be happier to do than to donate the m to a charity of obamas choice once he releases all of his records
in the spirit of transparency obama should immediately release the  tape of tyrone woods pleading for military support in benghazi
today barack obama is standing in water in nj remember on election day that he has put the us underwater
how many illegal foreign donations will obama collect this final week another scandal ignored by the liberal media
kevin garnetts response to ray allen last night was that of a great competitornothing wrongin fact it was terrific a champion
the president has until tomorrow at  noon to pick up m for his favorite charity looking like he wont be doing it what is he hiding
the polls  momentum  are trending towards mittromney dont let the hurricane change your thinking
maybe obama should donate my m to the families of the  who have lost loved ones during the storm
scary  obama and the democrat senate have accrued over t worth of debt without passing a budget in the last  yearsmore years
why does obama believe he shouldnt comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition hiding something
glad to hear that taylorswift will be cohosting the grammy nominations special ontaylor is terrific
lets be honest if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in ohio on monday
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on  the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi
without focus its just impossible to be successful at anything midas touch
i never fall for scams  i am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘ali g interview
another great cause obama could send my m donation to is a charity for  first responders they are american heroes
these last  years have not had a single quarter over  gdp obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in american history
the election is trending towards mittromney americans know we cant afford another  years of the obama economic decline
the trump tower atrium is such a great place  kept thousands of people warm  safe during the stormthanks staff

i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap i would have been lambasted from coast to coast
because of the hurricane i am extending my  million dollar offer for president obamas favorite charity until pm on thursday
not only giving out money but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president  dont fall for it
hurricane is good luck for obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars
if authorities need direct view from top of trump tower call office
direct view of crane from apartment window crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze
we are taking care of hundreds of people in the trump tower atriumthey are seeking refuge free coffee and food
many people walked out on madonnas concert when she told them to vote for obama years ago i walked out because the concert was terrible
obama lied  about libya and the killingsemails are absolute he must release his records on wednesday and stop the lies
dave letterman lateshow said during my interview that obama was probably born in the usthe word probably is a disaster for obama
im not hearing much from obama or his administration about my m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go
while bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct
bettemidler talks about my hair but im not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body  so i wont is this a double standard
i never liked bettemidlers persona or singing and havent heard her name in years
now grotesque bettemidler is into the trump act  trying to becomerelevant again
many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers  i agree
a lot changed when david letterman said  he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for obama
alertthe president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in benghazi he did nothinghe is no leader
i put donnydeutsch on apprentice at his request i did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my obama announcement
i want to end the day by saying there is no check i would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our president
the today show should call me about who to put on the show  i know more about people who get ratings than anyone
watch obamas favorability numbers drop even further if he doesnt accept my charitable offer no one approves cont
if obama doesnt accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say
if my offer is refused every undecided oh voter will be fully aware that obama denied m to charity all because he is hiding something
barack obama has everything to gain why would anyone ever deny m to charity
sarah jessica parker voted unsexiest woman alive  i agree she said its beneath me to comment on the
i have decided to add a caveat to my offer obama cant decide to send my m to rev wright if he releases his records
my fellow tea party friends in ohiomake sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day know you can must win ohio

by the way where is oprah good question  years ago she strongly supported obamanow she is silent anyway who cares i adore oprah
colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester the middle east is a mess yet colin powell still endorses him wonder why
be careful of an obama bomb to win election would be a horrible thing to do
the election is still close but trending toward mittromney he leads all national polls and obamas likeability is imploding vote
wow letterman show lateshow won the ratings last night big timeand guess who was his guest djt
one of my many twitter followers suggested obama should take my offer  give  to each family of the four
watch me explain on the lateshow how my charitable offer to obama changes the election and is about transparency
i knew last year that time magazine lost all credibility when they didnt include me in their top
the letterman show really turned things around people finally understand my  million dollar offer to charity
based on the ovation last night from the letterman lateshow audience i believe it will be hard for obama to throw m down the drain
another great charity that the m could go to just a recommendation to the pres  the wounded warriors represented so well by traceadkins
lots of response that obama should give the m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi
the dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants the america we deserve
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent
doing david letterman lateshow tonight at  st nite of sweepsgoing into the lions den but ive been there many times before enjoy
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires
for someone who demanded  years of mitts tax returns you would think my offer to donate m to charity for his records is an easy go
yesterday barack obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in china   i dont think this was a gaffe
